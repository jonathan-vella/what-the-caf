## Challenge 2  - Addressing Business Risks (45mins)

In this challenge you are required to understand business risk which is one of the most important elements of any cloud transformation. Risk drives policy, and it influences monitoring and enforcement requirements. Risk heavily influences how we manage the digital estate, on-premises or in the cloud.

**Learning objectives:**

- Understand the importance of business risk and the of mitigating common risks out-of-the-box

---

## Key Points to be covered

- Define your own business risk MVP which will support initial small scale cloud deployments, and which can then be used as a base for gradually identifying and remediating new risks as business needs arise or additional workloads are added to the customer's cloud environment.

## Challenge 2 – Success Criteria

1. Build a business risk MVP based on 6-8 risks.
2. Your MVP must clearly address the concern that a "move to Azure will result in additional business risk related to cost, security, and resiliency".
3. You must be able to demonstate how these risks are mitigated "out-of-the-box".
4. This MVP will be presented to non-technical audiences; choose your words wisely.
