# Module 02 - Strategy and Plan Hackathon

## Challenge 3 - Time to Plan (1hr 15mins)

This challenge's focus is to convert the aspirational goals of the cloud adoption strategy into an actionable plan. You will use the cloud adoption plan to guide technical efforts and align them with Contoso's business strategy.

Contoso is expecting you to present a high-level financial assessment. Your team will need to create an Azure Migrate assessment to gain an understanding of what the estimated costs would look like post-migration. You will need to use this [pre-populated Excel file](/learning_path_modules/02_Strategy_and_Plan_Hackathon/sources/Azure%20Migrate%20import%20template%20-%20Migration%20VF.csv); it contains information about Contoso’s current digital estate. Spend some time reviewing the contents of the file and the results of the Azure Migrate assessment. The final assessment will contribute to the team’s business case.

You're also expected to plan for skilling. When customers adopt the cloud, their existing technical staff will need a variety of new skills to aid 
in making technical decisions and to support the new cloud implementations. To ensure the long term success of the customer, you (the partner) must document a skilling plan to prepare the customer’s technical staff. This document must include a list of key customer technical roles expected to require new skills such as, but not limited to, IT Admins, IT Governance, IT Operations, and IT Security. The documentation must include:
- A description of the new skills the technical roles will need to achieve to successfully manage the new environment.
- Resources the customer can leverage when training their technical employees such as Microsoft learning paths, technical certifications, or other comparable resources.

**Learning objectives:**

- Take an inventory of a customer's digital estate & understand cloud costs.
- Get more familiar with the five Rs of rationalization which is the process of evaluating assets to determine the best way to migrate or modernize each asset in the cloud.
- Understand that a readiness plan will enable agile employees to explore and learn new cloud technologies instead of fearing them. These employess can lead the adoption of cloud services and help the organization learn and embrace the associated changes.
- The value of having a process and approach for planning and tracking the completion of cloud adoption projects.

## Challenge 3 – Success Criteria

1. Create an assessment report including cost estimates using the Azure Migrate tool.
2. Create a high-level workload rationalization plan which is de-risked by using cloud adoption horizons.
3. Create a readiness plan which maps roles and skills.
4. Translate strategy and effort into an actionable cloud adoption plan. This plan should clearly demonstrate that you have a process and approach for planning and tracking the completion of cloud adoption projects.
