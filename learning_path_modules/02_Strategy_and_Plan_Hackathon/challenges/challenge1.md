# What the CAF

## Module 02 - Strategy and Plan Hackathon

## Challenge 1

In this challenge you will learn about the 'Define Strategy' phase from the Cloud Adoption Framework.  You will get familiar and understand that there are many reasons and motivations for cloud adoption, and identifying and understanding them is key in developing an effective cloud adoption plan for the customer. 

Every customer has different priorities, processes, and organizational structures that need to be evaluated in order to guarantee a successful cloud journey. You will use this information to start building a business case which you will be presenting to the customer’s board.

**Learning Objectives:**

- Document motivations and benefits for moving to the cloud.
- Establish clear business outcomes, by key stakeholders or decision-makers, that align with your motivations.
- Define your business case by capturing a business justification through a financial model to project business impact.

## Key Points to be covered

- This challenge involves documenting motivations, business outcomes, and mapping them to key stakeholders to clearly articulate and answer the following questions:
  - “why does cloud make sense for my business?”
  - "how do I measure success?"
- Keep in mind that each team will be presenting all information back to the customer’s senior leadership team to justify adopting Azure (Challenge 4). 
- Your team should have completed the following items (preferably in order and together, but that is up to you):
  1. Use the [Cloud Journey Tracker](https://docs.microsoft.com/assessments/?mode=pre-assessment&id=cloud-journey-tracker) to understand the customer’s cloud adoption needs through this **assessment** tool
  2. Capture key **motivations** and **cloud benefits** for adopting the cloud. You can use the [Business outcome template spreadsheet](https://archcenter.blob.core.windows.net/cdn/business-outcome-template.xlsx) to document **business outcomes** by key stakeholder
  3. Consolidate all information in the [Strategy & Plan template](https://archcenter.blob.core.windows.net/cdn/fusion/readiness/Microsoft-Cloud-Adoption-Framework-Strategy-and-Plan-Template.docx) but *STOP before the “PLAN” section*.

## Pro Tips

## If you are a CxO at Contoso, what would be the possible benefits of Azure:

- How can Azure help Contoso focus on core differentiating activities? How can Contoso use the platform to accelerate innovation. For example how can they leverage cloud-native functionality for new drone services?
- What about the IaC and DevOps as a market differentiator?
- Business seasonality, cost variability, and scalability. But what about the impact of Reservations?
- Globally availability
- Cost management features which can support chargeback
- Compliance, Security, and ESU

## The Business Case

When building the **business case** (using the Strategy and plan template), focus on populating the most important aspects with the information you have.

Ask questions to your team, make educated guesses, but document assumptions. If you have time, The Student Guide document provides additional relevant information from Gartner reports which you can use to make more accurate financially-focused assumptions.

**Possible assumptions include:**

- IT spend is approximately 4.7% of revenue
- Cost can be optimized by 18% using the following measures
  - Right-sizing
  - Retiring >5% of applications
  - Snoozing applications out of business hours
  - Leveraging AHB
  - Leveraging Reservations
- Countries requiring additional measures to meet new global standards fall into the range 5% to 15% in low to high adjustment range
- Revenue will remain consistent in future

## Challenge 1 – Success Criteria

1. Complete the Cloud Journey Tracker assessment tool (take a screenshot and copy into the PPT which you will be using for Challenge 4)
2. Determine at least 3 (but not more than 5) motivations and cloud benefits according to the customer scenario.
3. Complete the Business Outcomes template. KPIs are a must-have. If you cannot measure, then it does not exist.
4. Complete the Strategy and Plan template but *STOP* at the “Plan” heading.
5. And don't forget to document any assumptions (remember that assumptions are the mother of all.....)
