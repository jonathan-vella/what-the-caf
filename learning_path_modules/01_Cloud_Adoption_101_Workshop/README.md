## What is the Cloud Adoption Framework?

The Cloud Adoption Framework is proven guidance that’s designed to help you create and implement the business and technology strategies necessary for your organization to succeed in the cloud. It provides best practices, documentation, and tools that cloud architects, IT professionals, and business decision makers need to successfully achieve their short- and long-term objectives.

By using Cloud Adoption Framework best practices, organizations are better able to align their business and technical strategies to ensure success.
